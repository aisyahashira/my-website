            <li style="list-style-position: inside;">
                Known human habitation of the Korean peninsula dates to 40,000 BC.

            <li style="list-style-position: inside;">
                The kingdom of Gojoseon, which according to tradition was founded in 2333 BC, fell to the Han dynasty in 108 BC.
                Goryeo overthrew Mongol rule before falling to a coup led by General Yi Seong-gye, who established the Joseon dynasty in 1392. 
                The first 200 years of Joseon were marked by peace; the Korean alphabet was created and Confucianism became influential.
            </li>
            
            <li style="list-style-position: inside;">
                It was followed by the Three Kingdoms period, in which Korea was divided into Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla. 
                n 1895, Japan defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese War and China lost suzerainty over Korea and Korea was placed under further Japanese influence. 
            In 1897, the centuries old Joseon was replaced by the Korean Empire with the Joseon's last king, Gojong, becoming the Emperor of the Korean Empire. 
            Japan's further victory in the 1904â€“1905 Russo-Japanese War, expelled Russian influence in Korea and Manchuria. 
            In 1905, the Korean Empire became a protectorate of the Empire of Japan. 
            In 1910, the Empire of Japan officially annexed the Korean peninsula.

            <li style="list-style-position: inside;">
                In 668 AD, Silla conquered Baekje and Goguryeo with the aid of the Tang dynasty, forming Unified Silla; Balhae succeeded Goguryeo in the north. 
            </li>

            <li style="list-style-position: inside;">
            In the late 9th century, Unified Silla collapsed into three states, beginning the Later Three Kingdoms period.

            <ul>

            <li style="list-style-position: outside;">
            In 918, Goguryeo was resurrected as Goryeo, which achieved what has been called a "true national unification" by Korean historians, 
            as it unified both the Later Three Kingdoms and the ruling class of Balhae after its fall.[4] 
            his ended with Japanese and Qing invasions, which brought devastation to Joseon and led to Korean isolationism. 
            After the invasions, an isolated Joseon experienced another nearly 200-year period of peace and prosperity, 
            along with cultural and technological development. 
            In the final years of the 19th century, Japan forced Joseon to open up and Joseon experienced turmoil such as the Gapsin Coup, Donghak Peasant Revolution, and the assassination of Empress Myeongseong.

            <li style="list-style-position: outside;">
            Goryeo, whose name developed into the modern exonym "Korea", was highly cultured and saw the invention of the first metal movable type. 
            </li>

            <li style="list-style-position: outside;">
            During the 13th century, Goryeo became a vassal state of the Mongol Empire.
